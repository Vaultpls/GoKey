<h1>GoKey!</h1>

<h2>How to demo:</h2>
Compile and run it like normal then get the last key generated and run the program with the argument "-key your-keys-here-nows"

<h3>Current Problems:</h3>
It doesn't detect that if it's a invalid key format.

<h4>How does it work?</h4>
It works by getting a accepted character list, randomly selects a character whilst getting it's integer number and adding up in total to compare to the "secret integer".  If it's equal to it's a good key!

Please add/remove/modify as you please! :D
